# tmoney-dilofestival-C-SDK
It's the C++ simple code to communicate with T-MONEY API

There are 1 example code in this SDK :

1. **API Sign In**
   It is the API to sign into T-MONEY environment, every activity in our APIs should be started with Sign In

It still shows error when compiling, so debugging is needed before it can run properly
